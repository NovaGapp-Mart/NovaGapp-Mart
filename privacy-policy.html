      Subject to applicable law and verification requirements, users may request access, correction, deletion, or restriction of personal information. Users may also request closure of their account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Account deletion requests may result in removal of profile data and user-generated content from active systems, subject to lawful retention exceptions for compliance, security, financial records, fraud prevention, and dispute handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain residual records may remain in backups or logs for a limited period consistent with legal and operational obligations.
